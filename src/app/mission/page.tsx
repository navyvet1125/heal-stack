            <strong>My mission is to bridge the gap between healing and technology</strong> — to create intentional, heart-centered spaces where spiritual insight, embodied care, and sound come together.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through Reiki, massage therapy, music, and thoughtful digital creation, I serve those who have discovered the need for change and are ready to embark on the next leg of their healing journey with a helpful guide.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that wholeness is built layer by layer — like a well-crafted system or a meaningful piece of music — and my role is to support that integration gently, with presence and purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether through the pulse of rhythm, the touch of code, or the resonance of energy, <strong>Heal-Stack is a sanctuary for healing, reflection, and transformation.</strong>
